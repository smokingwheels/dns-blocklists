## DNS Blocklists - *For a better internet!*

### ***Multi - Cleans the Internet and protects your privacy!***
*An all in one DNS blocklist in **various versions (light, normal, pro and pro++)**. It can be used as a stand alone blocklist. For every region. Blocks ads, affiliate, tracking, metrics, telemetry, fake, phishing, malware, scam, coins and other "crap". Based on [various blocklists](usedsources.md).*

<p align="center"><i><b>"If the plan doesn‘t work, change the plan but never the goal."<br>There's no place like 127.0.0.1!</b></i></p>

*The blocklists were created for personal, private use and are based on [various sources](usedsources.md). They were designed to avoid [false positive domains](whitelist.txt) as much as possible and not to block any needed features. [Dead hosts](deadlist.txt) are regularly removed from the lists to keep them as small as possible. Please [report false positive](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/issues) domains.*
